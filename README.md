## Virtual Trivia Form

> Test it out here! https://booth-quiz-form.web.app/
> View your new quiz [here](https://github.com/CrystalElseyNSS/virtual-trivia-game) by adding your Exhibitor Attendee Id to the end of the url

Used ReactJS to build a form where data coordinators could enter exhibitors' quiz questions & answers and have the quiz automatically populate in a separate application ([Virtual Trivia Game](https://github.com/CrystalElseyNSS/virtual-trivia-game)). The Trivia Form used Firebase Functions to post the quiz data to Cloud Firestore by exhibitor id.
