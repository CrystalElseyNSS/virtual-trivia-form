# Virtual Trivia Form

> Customizable booth trivia created for exhibitors for a virtual conference


## Project Info

Used ReactJS to build a form where data coordinators could enter exhibitors' quiz questions & answers and have the quiz automatically populate in a separate application ([Virtual Trivia Game](https://github.com/CrystalElseyNSS/virtual-trivia-game)). The Trivia Form used Firebase Functions to post the quiz data to Cloud Firestore by the Exhibitor Attendee Id.

> Test it out live at https://booth-quiz-form.web.app/   
> View your new quiz at https://sw-booth-trivia.web.app/ + {Exhibitor Attendee Id}
